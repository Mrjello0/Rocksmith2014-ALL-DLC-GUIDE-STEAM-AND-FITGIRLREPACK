tired of these dork losers who'll suck on any companies cock because it's a rule or tos I used to help on papermc discord server how to run the game on cracked accs 
I do it anywhere I can
dm'd a ton of people privately on the customsforge discord server how to unlock everything
but they finally banned me for saying "add me" literally policing people friending eachother under the assumption of guilt
I think I was justified in sharing tabs generated by another program but they still shouldn't have banned me for saying "add me" presuming guilt
