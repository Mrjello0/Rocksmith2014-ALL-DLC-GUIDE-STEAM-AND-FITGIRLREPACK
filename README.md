First aquire the base game either via the fitgirl repack/steam officialy even if you own it on steam official you'll need to get the fitgirl repack so I recomment using rqbit as a torrent it's 15mb and you can delete it after



https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit
to use it on windows you can open file explore to wherever it's downloaded and type cmd in the file explore address and then you can follow the usage instruction from the git but feel free to use any torrent you want



# for steam owners only fitgirl already has all official dlc 
get the folder location of steams install of rocksmith go to library click or right click rocksmith on the tab and click properties hit installed files and click browse this is the rocksmith 2014 root directory and all the rest of the folders will be referred to as sub folders

now to go to the rocksmith root folder all you need to do is copy all the DLC files over to steams from fitgirls repack dlc folders and also copy the root songs.psarc file to get rs1 songs working

and now you can also tack on the cdlc and it'll work fine




# for fitgirl repack users who want to get cdlc if not just enjoy the fitgirl repack
it's really easy to bypass you just need to replace the steam_api.dll with an official one then run the cdlc installer then put the original one from fitgirl repack or the game won't run without it

I'll be hosing the official steam_api.dll on this github that I used in 2025 before I bought rocksmith and the fitgirl repack one as well
